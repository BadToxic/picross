# Picross
## A picross (nanogram) game made with GameMaker

Picross is a nanogram game, well known as video game though Nintendo.

Nonograms, also known as Hanjie or Griddlers,
are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left
blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.
In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography
that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares
there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of
“4 8 3” would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares,
in that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups.

Nonograms have no theoretical limits on size, and are not restricted to square layouts.
